Here you can find various sample apps on how to use the GiPStech Mobile SDK.

In order to compile these apps you need to:
- Obtain a copy of the SDK from GiPStech and copy it where the file "put_gipstech_sdk_here.txt" is.
- Obtain a developmet key from GiPStech and copy it inside the code (in the DEV_KEY variable).
